Cryptopals in Haskell
=====================

A work in progress set of [matasano crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com/)
solutions in Haskell. These are my way of learning Haskell, so they probably
suck quite a lot.

Set up as a [stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) project.

`stack test` will run each of the challenges and determine whether correct
answers are obtained.
